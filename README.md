# Biometric-Attendance-Scanner-using-IoT

This presents a fingerprint-based biometric attendance system utilizing Arduino UNO
board and various components including the R305/R307 fingerprint sensor, DS3231/DS1307
RTC module, 16x2 LCD display, potentiometer, push buttons, buzzer, LED, connecting
wires, and a breadboard. The system aims to provide an efficient and secure solution for
attendance management in different organizations.The Arduino UNO board serves as the core
controller, responsible for coordinating the functionalities of the system. The R305/R307
fingerprint sensor captures and processes fingerprint images for authentication purposes. The
DS3231/DS1307 RTC module ensures accurate timekeeping, which is essential for recording
attendance records. The 16x2 LCD display provides a user-friendly interface for displaying
relevant information.Additional components such as the potentiometer, push buttons, buzzer,
LED, connecting wires, and breadboard are utilized for user interaction, feedback, and
connectivity purposes.By integrating these components with the Arduino platform, a reliable
and robust fingerprint-based biometric attendance system is developed, which improves
efficiency, accuracy, and security in attendance tracking for various organizations.

Testing and Calibration:
After uploading the firmware code, you
can proceed with testing the functionality.
of the attendance scanner system.
Test the fingerprint enrollment process by
capturing fingerprints and storing them
securely in the sensor's memory.
Test the fingerprint verification process by
comparing the captured fingerprint with
the enrolled fingerprints and determining if
they match.
Test the interaction with the LCD display
by displaying relevant information, such as
instructions, user feedback, date, time, or
attendance records.
Test the RTC module by ensuring accurate
timekeeping and synchronization with the
current date and time.
Test the user input handling by verifying
that the push buttons are properly
responding to user actions and triggering
the expected functionalities.
Calibrate the system as needed by
adjusting the settings, thresholds, or delays
to optimize performance and accuracy.

Result:
The accuracy of biometric attendance
scanner demonstrated high accuracy in
identifying individuals based on their
unique biometric features such as
fingerprints or facial characteristics. The
system achieved an overall accuracy rate
of 82% during the testing phase. The
scanner showed efficient performance by
quickly processing biometric data and
providing attendance records in real-time.
The average response time for attendance
verification was 3 seconds. The system
proved to be reliable, with a low false
acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection
rate. The IoT-based biometric attendance
scanner was designed to be user-friendly
and intuitive. Both administrators and
employees found the system easy to
operate, with clear instructions and
prompts. With IoT connectivity, attendance
data was instantly transmitted and
accessible to authorized personnel,
allowing them to monitor attendance in
real-time, detect anomalies, and take
timely actions if required. The
implementation of the biometric
attendance scanner led to long-term cost
savings by reducing the reliance on
traditional attendance systems and
streamlining attendance management
processes.
