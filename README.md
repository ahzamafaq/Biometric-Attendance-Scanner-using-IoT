# Biometric-Attendance-Scanner-using-IoT
This paper presents a fingerprint-based biometric attendance system utilizing Arduino UNO
board and various components including the R305/R307 fingerprint sensor, DS3231/DS1307
RTC module, 16x2 LCD display, potentiometer, push buttons, buzzer, LED, connecting
wires, and a breadboard. The system aims to provide an efficient and secure solution for
attendance management in different organizations.The Arduino UNO board serves as the core
controller, responsible for coordinating the functionalities of the system. The R305/R307
fingerprint sensor captures and processes fingerprint images for authentication purposes. The
DS3231/DS1307 RTC module ensures accurate timekeeping, which is essential for recording
attendance records. The 16x2 LCD display provides a user-friendly interface for displaying
relevant information.Additional components such as the potentiometer, push buttons, buzzer,
LED, connecting wires, and breadboard are utilized for user interaction, feedback, and
connectivity purposes.By integrating these components with the Arduino platform, a reliable
and robust fingerprint-based biometric attendance system is developed, which improves
efficiency, accuracy, and security in attendance tracking for various organizations.
